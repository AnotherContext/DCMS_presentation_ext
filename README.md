# DCMS presentation
An overview of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's activities, spending trends and eprformance.

What is it about?
-------
It is a web app and a simple overview of the DCMS' spending, resources, and performance trends that enables 
direct visual analysis of different types of activities and expenditure in a “compact” and easy way. 

To help identify possible trends and provide insight into the datasets, I use descriptive statistics and 
interactive visual tools that allow to dynamically explore and summarise the main characteristics of the dataset.

You can view the running app [here](https://wildsquare.shinyapps.io/DCMS_presentation_ext). It allows to create 
and customise graphical data summaries, e.g., barplots and boxplots in just a few clicks without prior knowledge of 
R (statistical programming language used in this project).

I used R and RStudio’s shiny framework for R. The graphical abilities of R and its packages ggplot2, shiny 
and shinyapps make it a very good choice for any data analysis and visualisation, while shiny enables turning 
statistical analysis into an interactive web application without the knowledge of HTML or Javascript. 
On the top of that, it adjusts the layout of the app for best viewing experience on desktops, tablets and smartphones.

One more thing I'd like to mention is that it is a self-learning project that I am doing it in my spare time.
